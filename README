# Vvis' CSGO mod

Features: 
- Added give_econ command to allow giving any econ item found in items_game.txt
- Added the ability to use local items game
- Removed the restriction on giving self custom knives (tested with econ item 515 butterfly knife)
- Added the ability to choose what knife you can spawn with via `set_spawn_knife` command 
  - Used like `set_spawn_knife butterfly` 

Potentially planned:
- Player model chooser?
- Restore original spray system like tf2/hl2dm

Requirements:
To compile this mod you need visual studio 2015 (or the v140 build tools)
To use this mod you need the csgo files via depotdownloader
-app 730 -depot 731 -manifest 7043469183016184477 -username USERNAME -password PASSWORD
-app 730 -depot 732 -manifest 4047004309608881181 -username USERNAME -password PASSWORD

Setup:
Once you have the files you need to copy them to the csgo-src\game folder 
after that do a full compile of the main solution on RELEASE to get the DLLs 
then just play the game via the exe after the compile is finished. 

TODO: Use legacy csgo branch assets with gamemounter and precompiled DLLs instead 


# Original Description
This project is aimed to improve the leaked CS:GO code, to make it more stable and to make it playable.
Use resources from CS:S to get the HUD and GameUI to work properly.

Partially used code from https://github.com/SwagSoftware/Kisak-Strike (some econ stuff, weapon recoil).

Features:
- Removed Scaleform;
- Filesystem from TF2 leak (less hardcoded stuff, allows for 'custom' folder, etc);
- Some VGUI stuff and complete GameUI ported from TF2 leak;

Currently known bugs:
- sv_pure is most likely broken due to differences between CS:GO and TF2 implementations that I was
  too lazy to fix for TF2 filesystem at 6AM, just 2 hours before going to college with no sleep;
- Game currently crashes after shutting down (something related to g_pCVar and outputting console messages,
  I think g_pCVar gets destructed before it is used for outputting console messages or something);
